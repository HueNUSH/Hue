  "moduleAbout": "Through this course, you will begin to realise that chemistry is all around us! The wonders of chemistry lie far beyond and exploration awaits you. This course is only the beginning of understanding our world with chemistry, and there is more to learn beyond this module. In this course, you will learn about the elements in the periodic table and how they exist as atoms which come together to form compounds and molecules. You will also get to learn how the periodic table works and more about the characteristics of the different periods and groups.",
